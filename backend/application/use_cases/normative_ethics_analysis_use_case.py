"""
Normative Ethics Analysis Use Case for the Ethical AI Testbed.

This module defines the use case for normative ethical analysis across major moral frameworks.
Normative ethics is concerned with establishing standards for determining what actions are
morally right or wrong, focusing on the practical application of ethical theories.

The normative ethics analysis provides:
- Detailed evaluation using virtue ethics (character-based approach)
- Analysis through deontological ethics (duty and rule-based approach)
- Assessment via consequentialist ethics (outcome-based approach)
- Comparative analysis across all three major ethical frameworks
- Identification of ethical conflicts between different normative perspectives

This use case serves as a specialized analysis endpoint that applies established
ethical theories to evaluate actions, policies, or statements according to
widely recognized moral frameworks.
