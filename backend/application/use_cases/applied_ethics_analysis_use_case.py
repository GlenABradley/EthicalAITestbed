"""
Applied Ethics Analysis Use Case for the Ethical AI Testbed.

This module defines the use case for applied ethical analysis for practical implementation.
Applied ethics focuses on specific ethical issues in particular contexts and professions,
applying ethical theories to real-world situations and domains.

The applied ethics analysis provides:
- Domain-specific ethical evaluations (e.g., bioethics, business ethics, AI ethics)
- Practical recommendations for ethical implementation
- Context-aware ethical guidelines and constraints
- Identification of domain-specific ethical challenges
- Actionable strategies for addressing ethical concerns in practice

This use case serves as a specialized analysis endpoint that bridges theoretical
ethical frameworks with practical implementation considerations, particularly
for machine learning systems and AI applications.
