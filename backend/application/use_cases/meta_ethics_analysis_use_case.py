"""
Meta Ethics Analysis Use Case for the Ethical AI Testbed.

This module defines the use case for meta-ethical analysis focusing on philosophical foundations.
Meta-ethics examines the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments,
addressing questions about the origin and meaning of ethical concepts.

The meta-ethics analysis provides:
- Examination of the nature and foundations of ethical judgments
- Analysis of moral realism vs. anti-realism perspectives
- Evaluation of cognitivist and non-cognitivist interpretations
- Assessment of moral relativism vs. universalism dimensions
- Exploration of ethical naturalism and non-naturalism frameworks

This use case serves as a specialized philosophical analysis endpoint that examines
the foundational assumptions and conceptual frameworks underlying ethical judgments.
