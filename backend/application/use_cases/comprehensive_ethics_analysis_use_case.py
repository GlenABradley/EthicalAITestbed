"""
Comprehensive Ethics Analysis Use Case for the Ethical AI Testbed.

This module defines the use case for comprehensive multi-framework ethical analysis.
It implements a complete ethical analysis that integrates virtue ethics, deontological ethics,
and consequentialist perspectives into a unified evaluation framework.

The comprehensive analysis provides:
- Multi-dimensional ethical assessment across all major philosophical frameworks
- Detailed scoring for each ethical dimension
- Identification of potential ethical concerns
- Recommendations for ethical improvements
- Confidence scores and uncertainty quantification

This use case serves as the most complete ethical analysis endpoint in the system,
utilizing all available ethical evaluation capabilities of the orchestrator.
