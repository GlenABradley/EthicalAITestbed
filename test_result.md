# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Enhanced Ethical AI Developer Testbed with v3.0 Semantic Embedding Framework + Phase 4 Heat-Map Visualization
  
  Build a sophisticated ethical AI evaluation system that implements:
  
  1. **v3.0 Semantic Embedding Framework**:
     - Core Axiom: Maximize human autonomy (Œ£ D_i) within objective empirical truth (t ‚â• 0.95)
     - Autonomy Dimensions: D1-D5 (Bodily, Cognitive, Behavioral, Social, Existential)
     - Truth Prerequisites: T1-T4 (Accuracy, Misinformation Prevention, Objectivity, Distinction)
     - Ethical Principles: P1-P8 (Consent, Transparency, Non-Aggression, Accountability, etc.)
  
  2. **Mathematical Framework**:
     - Orthogonal vector generation with Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization
     - Vector projection scoring: s_P(i,j) = x_{i:j} ¬∑ p_P
     - Minimal span detection with O(n¬≤) dynamic programming
     - Veto logic: E_v(S) ‚à® E_d(S) ‚à® E_c(S) = 1
     - 18% improvement in principle clustering
  
  3. **Autonomy-Based Evaluation**:
     - Detect violations against human autonomy principles
     - Precise identification of autonomy-violating text segments
     - Conservative assessment with mathematical rigor
     - Enhanced contrastive learning with autonomy-based examples
  
  4. **Production-Ready Implementation**:
     - FastAPI backend with v3.0 semantic integration
     - React frontend with autonomy-focused interface
     - MongoDB database with enhanced data structures
     - Comprehensive testing and validation
  
  Status: Version 1.0.1 - v3.0 Semantic Embedding Framework integrated and operational

Root cause: server.py line 355 calls evaluator.parameters.update(params) but EthicalParameters is a dataclass without an update() method. This prevents dynamic parameter adjustment during runtime. FIX NEEDED: Implement proper parameter update logic by directly setting dataclass attributes or adding an update method to EthicalParameters class.

Additionally, other obviously unethical phrases ('I hate you', 'I want to kill you', 'You are evil') are also NOT being flagged as unethical. This indicates a fundamental issue in the scoring algorithm, embedding generation, or ethical vector computation that prevents the system from detecting negative sentiment and harmful content. The mathematical framework appears to have a systematic bias toward ethical classification, which is a critical safety issue for production deployment."
