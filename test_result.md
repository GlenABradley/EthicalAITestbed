The 'Evaluate Text' button gets stuck in 'Evaluating...' state indefinitely. API requests to /api/evaluate are being made but no responses are received (0 API responses detected after 15+ seconds). This indicates a backend API timeout or hanging issue. All other UI elements function properly - tabs switch correctly, forms accept input, and no JavaScript errors are present. The issue is specifically with the backend evaluation endpoint not responding to requests."

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUE DISCOVERED: Comprehensive UI testing reveals that the user's report of 'nothing working' is partially incorrect. The frontend UI actually loads and functions properly for basic interactions (text input ✅, tab switching ✅, button clicks ✅, no JavaScript errors ✅). However, there IS a critical issue: the core 'Evaluate Text' functionality is completely broken. When users click 'Evaluate Text', the button gets stuck in 'Evaluating...' state indefinitely and never returns results. API requests are sent to /api/evaluate but no responses are received, indicating a backend API timeout or hanging issue. This explains why users think 'nothing works' - the main feature is broken. URGENT: Backend evaluation endpoint needs immediate investigation for timeout/hanging issues."

Response includes evaluation.spans, evaluation.minimal_spans, clean_text, and delta_summary as required. ✅ Issue 3 (ML Ethics Assistant functionality): All 5 ML Ethics endpoints fully functional - comprehensive-analysis, meta-analysis, normative-analysis, applied-analysis, and ml-training-guidance all return structured analysis data.

The system implements advanced Gaussian Process optimization, multi-objective Pareto analysis, and cross-validation which are computationally intensive. Parameter validation also times out, suggesting the system needs optimization for production use. RECOMMENDATION: Optimize computational performance or implement async background processing with progress tracking."
