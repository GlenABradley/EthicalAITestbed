        comment: "CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Frontend UI loads correctly and basic interactions work (text input, tab switching, button clicks), but the core evaluation functionality is broken. The 'Evaluate Text' button gets stuck in 'Evaluating...' state indefinitely. API requests to /api/evaluate are being made but no responses are received (0 API responses detected after 15+ seconds). This indicates a backend API timeout or hanging issue. All other UI elements function properly - tabs switch correctly, forms accept input, and no JavaScript errors are present. The issue is specifically with the backend evaluation endpoint not responding to requests."
