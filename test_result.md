The 'Evaluate Text' button gets stuck in 'Evaluating...' state indefinitely. API requests to /api/evaluate are being made but no responses are received (0 API responses detected after 15+ seconds). This indicates a backend API timeout or hanging issue. All other UI elements function properly - tabs switch correctly, forms accept input, and no JavaScript errors are present. The issue is specifically with the backend evaluation endpoint not responding to requests."

    message: "ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUE DISCOVERED: Comprehensive UI testing reveals that the user's report of 'nothing working' is partially incorrect. The frontend UI actually loads and functions properly for basic interactions (text input âœ…, tab switching âœ…, button clicks âœ…, no JavaScript errors âœ…). However, there IS a critical issue: the core 'Evaluate Text' functionality is completely broken. When users click 'Evaluate Text', the button gets stuck in 'Evaluating...' state indefinitely and never returns results. API requests are sent to /api/evaluate but no responses are received, indicating a backend API timeout or hanging issue. This explains why users think 'nothing works' - the main feature is broken. URGENT: Backend evaluation endpoint needs immediate investigation for timeout/hanging issues."
