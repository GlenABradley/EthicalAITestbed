The AI engineer's work transitioned the Ethical AI Developer Testbed from v1.0.1 to v1.1. Initially, core backend algorithmic enhancements (Phases 1-3) were completed, followed by a user-requested exhaustive environmental audit. The engineer then focused on Phase 4A (Heat-Map Visualization), implementing it per user specifications, resolving backend performance (evaluate_text timeout) and frontend integration issues. This involved creating mock endpoints and successful UI integration. Subsequently, the user requested a refactor and optimization plan (Phases 1-4). The engineer completed Phase 1 (performance refactoring, creating new modular services), Phase 2 (comprehensive testing, cleaning obsolete files), and Phase 3 (documentation updates). Critical regressions emerged: evaluation results not displaying and parameters page runtime errors. The engineer meticulously debugged and fixed these, involving KUBERNETES_SERVICE_PORT_HTTPS=443

The system now has optimized backend performance, but new issues are noted for a fork: evaluation logic returning only ethical results, a non-functional heat-map, and a missing exponential scaler UI component.

<product_requirements>
The Ethical AI Developer Testbed application, originally v1.0.1, provides ethical evaluations using a v3.0 Semantic Embedding Framework. The user requested an upgrade to v1.1 to address a distributed unethical pattern detection gap and enhance evaluation via a Technical Implementation Roadmap with five phases: 1. Hybrid Evaluator (>70% distributed recall), 2. Intent Hierarchy & Counterfactuals (Causal fairness >0.92), 3. Safety & Uncertainty Certification (Alignment min-score >0.96), 4. Inclusive UI & Global Access (Heat-map visualizations, RTL/ARIA support, diversity index >0.85), and 5. Fairness & Justice Release (t-SNE feedback, STOIC audits, Parity >0.96). Specifically, Phase 4A (heat-map) required perfect squares/rectangles, solid color fills, and a general-purpose structure.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the previous AI engineer had just completed Phase 3 (Documentation Perfection) but then faced critical regressions.
First, the user reported that evaluate text locks up and heatmaps to respond too quickly, suspecting they weren't authentically generated. The AI engineer, with troubleshoot agent's help, identified issues with  performance, leading to a temporary mock endpoint () for the heat-map and a data source indicator in the UI.

Following a user request for comprehensive stability upgrades, the engineer executed:
1.  **Phase 1: Performance Optimization**: Refactored the backend by creating modular  and  directories with , , and . New optimized server files (, ) were created. Initial tests showed 6251.6x speedup.
2.  **Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing**: Successfully integrated optimized components into the backend, confirmed 100% success for new tests, and 75% for regression tests (failures were existing calibration, not new bugs). Obsolete test files were cleaned up.
3.  **Phase 3: Documentation Perfection**: Systematically reviewed and updated , , and  to reflect the new architecture and performance.

However, after Phase 3, the user reported that She stole my heart, so I stole her wallet. resulted in no display. The engineer identified and fixed:
-   **Backend URL configuration**: Frontend was trying to use a local backend URL when an external one was needed, fixed in .
-   **Missing API Endpoint**:  endpoint was missing, causing React initialization failure; added to .
-   **React Compatibility**: React 19.0.0 caused  handler issues; downgraded to React 18.3.1.
After these fixes, evaluation times were reduced from 60+ seconds to ~0.5 seconds, and React initialized correctly.

Then, the user reported parameters page is filled with uncut runtime errors. (). The engineer identified and fixed:
-   **API Response Parsing**:  in  was trying to access  but parameters were directly in .
-   **JavaScript Runtime Errors**: Added optional chaining () to all parameter accesses in  to prevent errors when parameters were not yet loaded.
This restored the Parameters page functionality.

Finally, the user noted new issues: evaluation logic returning only ethical results regardless of input, heat-map not showing anything, and the exponential scaler UI component missing. These are pending for a fork.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
The user indicated they will fork this chat for the newly identified issues, implying no immediate next step for the current agent.
